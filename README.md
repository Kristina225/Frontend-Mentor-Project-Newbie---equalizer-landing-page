## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the biggest and hardest project I have done so far. I practiced positioning elements on the page, as well as using Flexbox to center elements. I also got to practice using backgrounds.

### Continued development

I'm still not comporftable with media queries. I need to do more research on best places to add breakpoints and desktop vs. mobile-first workflow for different types of projects.

### Useful resources

- [Change the fill of an SVG with CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252472/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-svg-element) - This helped me change the fill color of my SVGs by using a formula for the value of the filter property depending on the color.
